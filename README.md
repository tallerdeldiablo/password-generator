# password-generator


##
My motivation for this project was to learn to use javascript better using functions, methods, etc, in order to master the tool. The problem consists in generating a password, with conditions that the user must choose between the following options:
##
#Capital letters
#Lowercase letters
#Numbers
#Special characters

###
I decided to work on this project because it was a challenge to be able to code the algorithm so that it works correctly without errors. I learned to use better function methods and it helped me to better understand JS.
